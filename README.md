# Guess Who: The Sam Edition

For this project, I built off the original Guess Who code made by myself and two peers for the Google Computer Science Summer Institute in 2020. This edition introduces two new customized gameboards and an enhanced chat feature. Now, players can enter a username and be notified when other players join and exit the game

There is still room for improvement in this game. In the future, I would want to host the game on GitHub through GitHub pages for consistency. There could also be separate chat boxes for the two game boards, though for the scope and audience of the game, having one chat box for all the players to use will not hinder the game experience.
